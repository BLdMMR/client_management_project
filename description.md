# Goals for the project and project defenition
## Objective:
This is a project to manage clients and client products and to manage tasks and to-do lists
## Requirements:
- The program must allow client registation as well as the various departments of the client (Hospital: ICU, OR, ...)
- In each client sheet, there are 4 sections: Contacts, Products, Notes and Alerts.
- Each product category needs to be divided in whichever client deps there are (Monitors: ICU - Drager, OR - Philips. Ventilators: ICU - Drager, OR - Drager. ...)
- There are 3 types of notes: Simple notes, Task Notes, Comeback Notes. Simple notes don't have actions associated with them. Task notes are notes that should remind the user that something needs to be done. Comeback notes should remind the user that when they're going to a client they should do something. 
- The clients must be categorized by groups, that the user defines, which allows for the Comeback notes of each client to be grouped. 
- The products and categories are created by the user.
